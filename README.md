# Introduction to Snyk Platform Workshop

Snyk (pronounced sneak) is a developer security platform for securing code, dependencies, containers, and infrastructure as code. Snyk tests for vulnerabilities in your own code, open source dependencies, container images and infrastructure as code configurations, and offers context, prioritization, and remediation.

## :point_right: What languages does Snyk support?
At the time of this workshop Snyk supports: JavaScript, Java (Gradle, Maven), .NET, Python, Golang, Swift, Objective-C (CocoaPods), Scala, Ruby, PHP, and Bazel. Learn about Snyk‚Äôs language coverage in our support documentation.

## :point_right: What products and platforms does Snyk offer?
Snyk‚Äôs developer security platform integrates four key products: Snyk Open Source, Snyk Code, Snyk Container, and Snyk Infrastructure as Code (Kubernetes, Terraform, etc.).

## :point_right: Which tools, IDEs, and platforms does Snyk integrate with?
Taking a developer-first approach to security, Snyk integrates with leading IDE, repository, CI/CD, runtime, registry, and issue management tools.

## :point_right: How does Snyk‚Äôs security and vulnerability data compare to other vulnerability databases?
Our security intelligence database, also known as the Snyk Intel Vulnerability Database is maintained by a dedicated research team that combines public sources, contributions from the developer community, proprietary research, and machine learning to continuously adapt to the changing and expanding nature of security threats.

## :point_right: Does Snyk have a CLI?
You can use the CLI for scanning and monitoring on your local machine, and integrate it into your pipeline. You can use the Snyk CLI to scan your applications, containers, and infrastructure as code for security vulnerabilities.You can install the CLI via npm, Homebrew, Scoop, or manually. Learn more in our Snyk CLI documentation.

# Snyk Open Source Steps

Snyk Open Source is a Software Composition Analysis took which seamlessly and proactively finds, prioritizes and fixes vulnerabilities and license violations in open source dependencies

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ - Step 5 - Find vulnerabilities

* Since Juice-Shop project had been imported in the Step 3, you should see a "**package.json**" project as shown below. 

![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/d4Qb3TV/Snyk-OS-vuln.png)

* Click on the second "**package.json**" to view our Open Source scan results

First let's explore the Juice-Shop project risks by clicking on the "**package.json**" file which is the manifest file where the open source dependencies are declared.

![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/ZhN6tXY/Package-json-view.png)

Thenk go back on the Snyk WebUI and let's have a look at the vulnerabilities.

For each Vulnerability, Snyk displays the following ordered by our [Proprietary Priority Score](https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-priority-score/) :
1. The module that introduced it and, in the case of transitive dependencies, its direct dependency,
1. Details on the path and proposed Remediation, as well as the specific vulnerable functions
1. Overview
1. Exploit maturity
1. Links to CWE, CVE and CVSS Score
1. Plus more ...

![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/xq2GWCs/Snyk-OS-vuln.png)

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ - Step 6 - Fix using a Pull Request

When using the GitHub integration, and if a fix is available, Snyk can automatically upgrade the vulnerable dependency to a non-vulnerable version through a Pull Request. 

* Click on "**Fix this vulnerability**" for "**typeorm Prototype Pollution**" issue as shown below

![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/9NHPmn2/Snyk-OS-Fix-this-vuln.png)

* On the next screen, you'll be able to confirm the issue to fix with this PR. Click "**Open a Fix PR**"

![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/y5PHhhT/Vulns-to-fix-pr-view.png)
![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/p2Lx5Rd/Open-fix-pr-button.png)

* Once it's ready, you'll be taken to the PR in GitHub, where you can review the changes in the file diff view:

Snyk integrates with your preferred Git repository to scan your manifest files for any new code and potential vulnerabilities whenever you submit a pull request (PR), protecting the security of your code before you ever merge it with the main branch

![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/ySc72zN/Fix-PR-Github.png)

* We see that CI checks completed successfully, assuring us we didn't introduce a breaking change

![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/BzrNHvg/Files-changed-Github.png)

* Optionally now, go ahead and merge the PR!
* Back in Snyk we can appreciate that our package.json file has 1 less Critical Severity Vulnerability if you did fix it

# Snyk Container Steps

Snyk Container helps you find and fix vulnerabilities in container images. With snyk container you can scale your security capabilities by enabling developers to quickly eliminate a multitude of vulnerabilities by upgrading to a more secure base image or rebuilding when the base image is outdated

You may not always have access to the original source code that runs in your containers, but vulnerabilities in your code dependencies are still important. Snyk can detect and monitor open source dependencies for popular languages as part of the container scan

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ - Step 7 - Find vulnerabilities in Juice Shop's Dockerfile

Snyk detects vulnerable base images by scanning your Dockerfile when importing a Git repository. This allows you to examine security issues before building the image, so helps solve potential problems before they land in your registry or in production.

* Since Juice-Shop project had been imported in the Step 3, you should see a reference for the Dockerfile as shown below. 

![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/3F6v7x7/Snyk-Container-results.png)

In a Dockerfile project, you can find the relevant metadata of the Dockerfile and the base image used. If the base image is an [Official Docker image](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_images/), the results include recommendations for upgrades to resolve some of the discovered vulnerabilities.
This is handy as we can remove a substantial amount of issues just by using an alternative base image from minor upgrades to major upgrades if available will be shown including what issues will remain if the basde image is changed and the container re-built.  

![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/myJ2Yf4/Snyk-Container-recommendations-base-image.png)

The supported base images can be found at this [link](https://snyk.io/docker-images/)

For each Vulnerability, Snyk displays the following ordered by our [Proprietary Priority Score](https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-priority-score/) :

1. The module (O/S, base image) that introduced it and, in the case of transitive dependencies, its direct dependency
1. Details on the path and proposed Remediation, as well as the specific vulnerable functions
1. Overview
1. Exploit maturity
1. Links to CWE, CVE and CVSS Score
1. Social Trends
1. Plus more ...

![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/X72chjn/Snyk-Container-vuln.png)

## :height: - Step 8 - Fix the Dockerfile FROM tag using a Pull Request

Here we will go ahead and fix our Dockerfile using the "**Open a Fix PR**" button as follows:

* Click on "**Open a Fix PR**" for the base image "**node:17.4-slim**" as per below

![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/1ftgqXL/Open-a-fix-PR-image.png)

* Click on "**Open a Fix PR**" on the resulting page as shown below

![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/nkfQ6nY/Open-a-fix-PR-Image-2.png)

* A PR is then created as show below. 

![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/sCP7Fk3/Github-fix-PR-base-image.png)

"**Files Changed**" will show you what it's updating in the Dockerfile itself

![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/Sfzxm6s/Github-fix-PR-base-image-files-changed.png)

* Click on "**Merge Pull Request**" 

* Return to the projects dashboard and you will see a new scan has occurred automatically and now our Dockerfile shows much less issues than previously. 

![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/vzndsKy/Snyk-Container-new-base-image.png)

## üìñ To Go Further with Snyk Container - Snyk Container workshop

Finally, to go further, feel free to look at this workshop https://github.com/papicella/snyk-container-workshop where you will be able to scan a container image from a Docker Hub integration and do Container test using the Snyk CLI.

# Snyk Infrastructure as Code Steps

Snyk Infrastructure as Code allows you to find and fix vulnerabilities in your Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, ARM and CloudFormation configuration files

Developer-focused infrastructure as code security with Snyk allows you to test and monitor Terraform modules and Kubernetes YAML, JSON, and Helm charts to detect configuration issues that could open your deployments to attack and malicious behavior.

## :nine: - Step 9 - Find vulnerabilities in Juice-Shop‚Äôs Kubernetes.yml

* Since Juice-Shop project had been imported in the Step 3, you should see a reference for the Dockerfile as shown below. 

![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/zRB8dqY/Snyk-Ia-C-results.png)

For each Vulnerability, Snyk displays the following ordered by Line no:

1. Each Vulnerability grouped by line no and severity 
1. Each Vulnerability links to the Snyk policy it was defined against including the path to the issue, what the issue is, the impact and how to resolve it
1. The ability to ignore issues you wish to remove from the list
